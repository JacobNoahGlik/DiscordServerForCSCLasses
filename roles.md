"Hello. Which channel would you like the message to be in?" - Carl-bot

> #⁠roles

"Alright, the channel is ⁠roles. What would you like the message to say? Use a | to separate the title from the description, like so"
"    `This is a title | this is the description`"
"You can also type {roles} to have it replaced with a list of each emoji and its associated role." - Carl-bot

> Wanna show off that major? Pick the one that fits you best! | {roles}

"Alright, I got a title and a description, would you like the message to have a color? Respond with the hex code or 'none' to skip."
"Not sure what a hex code is? Check out https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-picker/." - Carl-bot

"Alright, the message will look like this. Next up we will add roles"
"The format for adding roles is emoji then the name of the role. When you're done, type 'done'"
"**Example:**"
"`:smile: league of legends`" - Carl-bot
